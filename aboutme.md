Hello! My name is Albert Tucci, I am a bioinformatician based out of Raleigh, North Carolina with a wide variety of research interests. Just this Spring, I graduated from North Carolina State University with a Ph. D. in bioinformatics after 5 years of under the tutelage of Drs. Robert Franks and Jung-Ying Tzeng.

My work in the Franks lab focused on performing statistical analyses and leveraging machine learning models using a variety of next generation sequencing data to gain insights into hybrid seed development in monkeyflowers. Meanwhile, my work in the Tzeng lab centered around comparing methods for performing copy number variation (CNV) association analyses using data from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP).

Prior to arriving at NC State in 2020, I completed an M.S. in biology at East Carolina University as a member of the John Stiller lab. My masters project involved analyzing and characterizing the transcriptome of the stigma tissue of Leptosiphon jepsonii, a flowering plant that exhibits a rare pattern of transient self-incompatibility. Additionally, while at ECU I worked as a teaching assistant under Dr. Elizabeth Jones where I taught 3 sections of the introduction to human anatomy lab each semester that I was there.

Before my time at ECU, I completed a B.S. in quantitative biology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.


To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
